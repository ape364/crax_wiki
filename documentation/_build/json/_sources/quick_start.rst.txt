Tarantool is a Lua application server integrated with a database management system.
It has a "fiber" model which means that many Tarantool applications can run simultaneously on
a single thread, while each instance of the Tarantool server itself can run multiple threads for input-output
and background maintenance. It incorporates the LuaJIT -- "Just In Time" -- Lua compiler,
Lua libraries for most common applications, and the Tarantool Database Server which
is an established NoSQL DBMS. Thus Tarantool serves all the purposes that have made node.js
and Twisted popular, plus it supports data persistence.
Mail.Ru's hottest data, such as the session data of online users, the
properties of online applications, the caches of the underlying data, the
distribution and sharding algorithms, and much more. Outside Mail.Ru the
software is used by a growing number of projects in online gaming, digital
marketing, and social media industries. Although Mail.Ru is the sponsor
for product development, the roadmap and the bugs database and the development process are
fully open. The software incorporates patches from dozens of community
contributors. The Tarantool community writes and maintains most of the drivers
for programming languages.  The greater Lua community has hundreds of useful
packages most of which can become Tarantool extensions.

Users can create, modify and drop **Lua functions** at runtime.
Or they can define **Lua programs** that are loaded during startup for triggers,
background tasks, and interacting with networked peers.
Unlike popular application development frameworks based on a "reactor" pattern,
networking in server-side Lua is sequential, yet very efficient, as it is built
on top of the **cooperative multitasking** environment that Tarantool itself
uses.

One of the built-in Lua packages provides an API for the Database Management System.
Thus some developers see Tarantool as a DBMS with a popular stored
procedure language, while others see it as a Lua interpreter,
while still others see it as a replacement for many
components of multi-tier Web applications. Performance can be a few
hundred thousand transactions per second on a laptop, scalable upwards or outwards to
server farms.
